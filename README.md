# Day-Planner 
This is a day-planner application created to organize a user's tasks throughout a workday. Users can open the planner where the current day and time is displayed at the top of the page. Users can insert their tasks, save them, and update them. Refreshing the page will not delete their tasks. Timeblocks will be red for present events, grey for past events, and green for future events. To reset or clear the calendar, simply click on the button under the date and time display at the top. 

Here is the appearance of this application:
